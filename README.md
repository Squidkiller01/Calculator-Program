# Calculator-Program
​A Scientific Calculator program coded in Python in the hopes of serving as a formulas calculator for those that struggle solving math formulas. More more complex formulas, the calculator would provide the user with an explanation on how it got the correct answer they were looking for.

Project was created March 4th as a side project to give me something to do to stay busy. March 17th, with 40 lines of code, it was decided that the Calculator program would serve as the project for the TSA Software Development project. Later in April, the program was submitted as the finished project, around 400 lines with basic math and geometry were included in the program. Afterwards, it became an abandoned project over the summer. Around the beginning of my sophomore year of school in August, the project was picked back up until March 7, 2022 where the project was abandoned for focus on school projects.

The program was left with 2,411 lines of code. It included optimized and compressed code so all known possible errors had been fixed and included basic arithmetic, geometry, algebra, as well as some physics equations. The program also featured a change-log to view latest and past updates as well as comments in code to make it more readable to non-coders, easter eggs to find throughout the program by typing certain phrases, and finally randomized leave messages with a more rare message when exiting the program.
